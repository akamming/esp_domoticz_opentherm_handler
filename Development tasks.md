# TODO
- Make CLimate settings persistent (partially done, retain also when config saved from inteface + make a delay for savesettings to prevent a lot of saving)
- Implement weather dependent mode
- stop heating/cooling when temp too old or no connection to mqtt
- use internal temp as measurement for PID (optional)
